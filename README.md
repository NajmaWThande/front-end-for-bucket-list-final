# Bucket List Project

The Bucket List Project is a web application that allows users to create and manage their personal bucket lists. It provides a platform to keep track of goals, dreams, and experiences users want to accomplish within their lifetime. The project combines the backend framework Sinatra with the frontend library ReactJS to create an interactive and dynamic user experience.

## Features

1. Bucket List Creation: Users can create multiple bucket lists and add items to each list.

2. Item Management: Users can add, edit, and delete items within their bucket lists.
3. Marking Items as Completed: Users can mark items as completed when they have achieved their goals.
4. Categories: Users can create categories to their liking and items to them.

## Technologies Used

1. Sinatra: A lightweight Ruby web application framework that handles routing and backend logic.

2. SQLite: A powerful open-source relational database for data storage.

3. ActiveRecord: A Ruby ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library for database interactions.
